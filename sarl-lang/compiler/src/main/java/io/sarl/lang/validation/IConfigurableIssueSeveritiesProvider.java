/** A configurable issue severity provider.
 *
 * <p>This issue severity provider provides a public API for dynamically
 * and programmatically changing the severity of the issues.
 * For the Eclipse implementation of the provider, the standard severity provider
 * gets the severity levels from the preferences.
 * But, this configurable issue severity provider should not change the preferences.
 * The contract is to have internal overriding of the preferences in this provider.
 *
 * <p>Usually, the implementation of this provider is a specific {@link IssueSeveritiesProvider}
 * implementation.
