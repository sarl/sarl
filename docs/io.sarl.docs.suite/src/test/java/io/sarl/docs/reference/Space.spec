/* @outline
 *
 * <p>This document describes the features related to the definition of a space in SARL.
 * Before reading this document, we recommend that you read
 * the [General Syntax Reference](GeneralSyntaxReferenceSpec.html),
 * and the [Agent Reference](AgentReferenceSpec.html).
 * 
 * <p>One of the key elements that characterize and differentiate the main 
 * multi-agent approaches is how interactions between agents are described.
 * Some researchers focus on agent-to-agent interactions and corresponding 
 * protocols. Within organizational approaches, some consider the 
 * organization as a static partition of agents where agents interact in 
 * groups through the roles they play. Others focus on dynamic 
 * organizations and normative aspects. 
 * 
 * <p>Another essential aspect of the interaction is the interaction 
 * Agent-Environment, especially in agent-based simulations.
 * Each of these trends of multi-agent systems has led to numerous 
 * fruitful and innovative contributions.
 * To remain generic, SARL therefore not imposes a single way of 
 * describing the interaction among agents, but rather attempt to 
 * provide means to implement each of these approaches.
 * 
 * <p>It is in this perspective that the concepts of `Space`
 * and `SpaceSpecification` were defined.
 * 
 * <p>__A Space is the support of the interaction between agents respecting 
 * the rules defined in a Space Specification.__
 * 
 * <p>__A Space Specification defines the rules (including action and
 * perception) for interacting within a given set of spaces respecting 
 * this specification.__
 * 
 * <p>SARL natively defines a particular type of `Space` called
 * *Event Space* to provide a support to event-driven interactions.
 * Within an event space, agents communicate using events, the 
 * [built-in capacity `DefaultContextInteractions`](BuiltInCapacityReferenceSpec.html)
 * provides the agent with the means to emit and receive events, respectively 
 * using the `emit` actions and the `on` keyword
 * in behavior definition.
 * A __Default Space__ is precisely an event space.
 * 
 * <p>Within an event space, the notion of `Scope` enables to 
 * precisely control/filter the potential recipients of an event.
 * __A Scope is a predicate used to filter the potentially called 
 * listeners for a given event.__
 * The most basic scope is represented by a collection of addresses.
