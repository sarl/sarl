/* @outline
 *
 * <p>This document describes the basics of the creation
 * and design of holons in SARL. This tutorial is applied
 * on a simple English auction application.
 * Before reading this document, it is recommended reading
 * the [General Syntax Reference](../reference/GeneralSyntaxReferenceSpec.html).
 * The architecture presented in this tutorial may be
 * used for designing a system in which a decision must be
 * taken after arbitration among components.

 * According to the vocabulary used in the SARL project,
 * all the agents are holons. In the rest of this tutorial,
 * the terms "agent" and "holon" are synonymous. 
 * 
 * <p>The elements that are explained in this tutorial are:
 * 
 *  * the definition of an event;
 *  * the definition of a super-agent;
 *  * the definition of a sub-agent;
 *  * the emit of events from the super-agent to its sub-agent;
 *  * the emit of events from the sub-agent to its super-agent.
 *
 * <note>The communication between
 * the sub-agents is out of the scope of this tutorial. For interested
 * readers, the [Agent Reference](../reference/AgentReferenceSpec.html)
 * may be read.</note>
 * 
 * <p>The source code related to this tutorial may be found

		/*
		 * This type of auction is arguably the most common form of auction in use today.
		 * Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid required to 
		 * be higher than the previous bid. An auctioneer may announce prices, bidders
		 * may call out their bids themselves.
		 * The auction ends when no participant is willing to bid further, at which
		 * point the highest bidder pays their bid.
		 * Alternatively, if the seller has set a minimum sale price in advance 
		 * (the 'reserve' price) and the final bid does not reach that price the item 
		 * remains unsold.
		 * Sometimes the auctioneer sets a minimum amount by which the next bid must
		 * exceed the current highest bid. The most significant distinguishing factor of
		 * this auction type is that the current highest bid is always available to 
		 * potential bidders.

		 * This is typically the case in the auction application.
