/* @outline
 *
 * <p>This document describes how to define Capacities in SARL.
 * Before reading this document, we recommend that you read
 * the [General Syntax Reference](GeneralSyntaxReferenceSpec.html).
 * 
 * <p>An *Action* is code (a public method or function) that transforms a part of the 
 * designed system or its environment. This transformation guarantees 
 * resulting properties if the system before the transformation satisfies 
 * a set of constraints. An Action is defined in terms of pre- and post-conditions.
 * 
 * <p>A *Capacity* is the specification of a collection of Actions. This specification 
 * makes no assumptions about the implementation of each Action. It is used to specify 
 * what an Agent can do, what behavior is required for its execution.
 * 
 * <p>A *Skill* is a collections of Actions implementing a Capacity as described in
 * this specification.
 * 
 * <p>An Agent can dynamically evolve by acquiring (learning) new Capacities, and it 
 * can also dynamically change the Skill associated with a given Capacity.
 * Acquiring a new Capacity enables an Agent to get access to new behaviors.
 * This provides Agents with a self-adaptation 
 * mechanism that allows them to dynamically change their architecture according to 
 * their current needs and goals.
