 * <p>SARL enables to declare objects with an object-oriented programming approach.
 * This document describes the basic support of object-oriented programming provided by SARL.
 * Before reading this document, we recommend that you read
 * the [General Syntax Reference](./GeneralSyntaxReferenceSpec.html).
 * 
 * <p>The support of the object-oriented programming (OOP) statements in SARL is less complete
 * than a real object-oriented language such as Java.
 * The basics of OOP are enabled in the SARL scripts. If you need more complex or more
 * complete support of the OOP, you should use a dedicated language, such as Java,
 * [Xtend](https://eclipse.org/xtend/), or [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).
 * 
 * <note>The SARL Eclipse product includes the tools for programming with the Java and Xtend languages</note>

		 * The `strictfp` modifier is a keyword that restricts floating-point calculations to ensure portability.

		 *
		 * <p>The IEEE standard IEEE 754 specifies a standard method for both floating-point calculations and
		 * storage of floating-point values in either single (32-bit, used in float) or double (64-bit, used in double)
		 * precision, and, for intermediate calculations, also extended precision formats.
		 * 
		 * <p>Since JVM 1.2, intermediate computations are not limited to the standard 32 bit and 64 bit precisions.
		 * On platforms that can handle other representations e.g. 80-bit double extended on x86 or x86-64 platforms,
		 * those representations can be used, helping to prevent round-off errors and overflows, thereby increasing
		 * precision.
		 *
		 * <p>For some applications, a programmer might need every platform to have precisely the same floating-point
		 * behavior, even on platforms that could handle greater precision. However, if this level of precision is not
		 * necessary the VM does not use intermediates by default.
		 * 
		 * <p>From the VM perspective, turning on this higher precision means the following:
		 * <table><thead>
		 * <tr><th>Precision</th><th>Intermediate</th></tr>
		 * </thead><tbody>
		 * <tr><td>32 bits</td><td>64 bits</td></tr>
		 * <tr><td>64 bits</td><td>80 bits (if available)</td></tr>
		 * </tbody></table>

		 * The `strictfp` modifier accomplishes this by truncating all intermediate values to IEEE single precision and
		 * double precision, as occurred in earlier versions of the JVM.

		 * While the `volatile` modifier itself comes from the C programming language, it has a completely

		 * googling for volatile could lead to different results. Let's take a quick side step and see what
		 * volatile means in C first.
		 * 
		 * <p>In the C language the compiler ordinarily assumes that variables cannot change value by themselves.
		 * While this makes sense as default behavior, sometimes a variable may represent a location that
		 * can be changed (like a hardware register). Using a volatile variable instructs the compiler
		 * not to apply these optimizations.
		 *
		 * <p>Back to Java and SARL. The meaning of volatile in C would be useless in Java. The JVM uses
		 * native libraries to interact with the OS and hardware. Further more, it is simply impossible
		 * to point Java variables to specific addresses, so variables actually won't change value by themselves.
		 *
		 * <p>However, the value of variables on the JVM can be changed by different threads. By default the
		 * compiler assumes that variables won't change in other threads. Hence it can apply optimizations such
		 * as reordering memory operations and caching the variable in a CPU register. Using a volatile variable
		 * instructs the compiler not to apply these optimizations. This guarantees that a reading thread
		 * always reads the variable from memory (or from a shared cache), never from a local cache.
		 *
		 * <note>From now, it is better to use
		 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/package-summary.html">atomic
		 * references</a> in place of volatile variables.</note>
