			 * 
			 * <p>SARL aims to provide the fundamental abstractions 
			 * for dealing with concurrency, distribution, interaction, 
			 * decentralization, reactivity, autonomy, and dynamic 
			 * reconfiguration. These high-level features are now 
			 * considered the major requirements for an easy and 
			 * practical implementation of modern complex software 
			 * applications. We are convinced that the agent-oriented 
			 * paradigm holds the keys to effectively meet this challenge.
			 * 
			 * <p>Considering the variety of existing approaches and 
			 * meta-models in the field of agent-oriented engineering 
			 * and more generally multi-agent systems, our approach 
			 * remains as generic as possible and highly extensible 
			 * to easily integrate new concepts and features.
			 * 
			 * <p>__The language is platform- and architecture-independent.__
