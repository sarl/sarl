/** Annotation for marking a function that is supposed to be run in parallel.
 * Any function that is marked with this annotation may return from its call
 * before the expected behavior of the function is really ran. In other words,
 * It is an indicator that may be used by the SARL editor for displaying this function
 * in a different way to the SARL developper.
