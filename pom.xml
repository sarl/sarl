	<name>Janus Experience Index</name>

	<description>
	The JEI is inspirated by the Windows Experience Index. It measures the capability of your computer’s hardware and software configuration, including the Java virtual machine, and expresses this measurement as a number called a base score. A higher base score generally means that your computer will perform better and faster than a computer with a lower base score. The JEI is a score between 1 and
6. This index was introduced to help the Janus users and developers to compare the performances of the platform on different hardware configurations.
