The steps for releasing SARL are:

== 1) PHASE 1: RELEASE CANDIDATE VERSION

=== 1.1) Upgrade all the versions in the pom files and the Eclipse platform

** Upgrade the Eclipse target platform
** Synchronize the versions in the pom files (plugins and dependencies) with the same version numbers as in the Eclipse target platform.

=== 1.2) Update the Copyright texts in the file headers

IF the release is supposed to be the first of a new year, you should change the last years in all the copyright texts.

NOTE: This task is automated by the `./scripts/prepare-release.sh` script when it is called with the following option: `--copyrights`.

In the `.sarl` and `.java` files:

* Replace `Copyright (C) <DATES> SARL.io, the Original Authors and Main Authors` by the current SARL text.
* Replace `Copyright (C) <DATES> the original authors or authors` by the current SARL text.

=== 1.3) Compiling locally without error

     $> rm -rf $HOME/.m2/repository
     $> ./build-all.sh

=== 1.4) Commit all the changes

=== 1.5) Tag the version

* Tag the version with with `vX.Y.Z-rcN`, where `N` is the release candidate number.
* Push the tag on Github.

=== 1.6) Do manual tests

If a manual test is failing, fix the problem, and go to step 1.2.

=== 1.7) Maven Central Bundles

Test the generation of the  bundles for Maven Central:

     $> ./scripts/prepare-maven-central.sh

=== 1.8) Javadoc Generation

Test the generation of the Javadoc for the public API (the real generation will be done by the script of the website):

     $> ./scripts/generate-aggregate-javadoc.sh

== 2) PHASE 2: RELEASE VERSION

=== 2.1) Create a branch for the release

In order to manage any bug fix of the release version, independently to the master, it is preferable to create a specific branch for the release.

     $> git branch X.X.X
     $> git checkout X.X.X
     
where `X.X.X` is the version of the release.

=== 2.2) Update the graphical resources

If necessary, updates the UI resources:

* **Splash screens**
** Update the picture into the eclipse plugins:
*** A file `splash.bmp` for the main SARL IDE application with `R8G8B8` configuration (no `A9`)
	to be copied into the module `io.sarl.eclipse.ideapp`
*** A file `splash.bmp` for the main SARL DSL application with `R8G8B8` configuration (no `A9`)
	to be copied into the module `io.sarl.eclipse.devapp`
*** Find the name of the author of the background image, and update the following files to mention this author:
**** file: `io.sarl.eclipse*/OSGI-INF/l10n/bundle.properties`, field: `about.general.text`
* **Picture for the "about" dialog box**
** Update the picture into the eclipse plugins:
*** The file `eclipse-about-banner.png` for both the main SARL IDE and DSL applications with standard PNG configuration		

=== 2.3) Change the version numbers

NOTE: This task is automated by the `./scripts/prepare-release.sh` script when it is called with the following options: `--releaseversion`.

==== 2.3.1) Remove snapshot markers

Remove all the occurrences of `-SNAPSHOT` in all the poms.

CAUTION: Do not remove the `-SNAPSHOT` in the Groovy scripts.

==== 2.3.2) Update the versions in the Eclipse configurations

* Remove `.qualifier` in the `MANIFEST.MF` files (in `Bundle-Version`).
* Remove `.qualifier` in the `feature.xml` files (in root tag and in the "sarl" and "janus"" plugins references).
* Remove `.qualifier` in the `*.product` files (in root tag and feature tag).
* Remove `.qualifier` in the `category.xml` files (in feature tags, url and version).

=== 2.3.3) Update General and Contributor Readme Files

Update the content of the files `README.adoc` and `CONTRIBUTING.adoc` for using the new version numbers.

=== 2.4) Update the Javadoc Tags

NOTE: This task is automated by the `./scripts/prepare-release.sh` script when it is called with the following options: `--author`, `--maven`.

In the `.sarl` and `.java` files:

* Replace `$FullVersion$` by the current SARL version number, with the release date.
* Replace `$GroupId$` by the group name of the current Maven module.
* Replace `$ArtifactId$` by the artifact name of the current Maven module.
* Replace `$Author$` by the hyperlink of the contributor with the identifier `ID`.

=== 2.6) Comment any reference to the Snapshot Maven repository

Into the root `pom.xml` files, comment any reference to a snapshot maven repository.

=== 2.6) Compiling locally without error

     $> rm -rf $HOME/.m2/repository
     $> ./build-all.sh
     
NOTE: Copy the Eclipse products from `sarl-eclipse/products/io.sarl.eclipse.products.ide/target/products/` in a safe folder for being used in Phase 3.

NOTE: Copy the CLI products from `sarl-cli/*/target/` in a safe folder for being used in Phase 3. Do not missed the products for Linux, Windows and MacOS. 

=== 2.7) Check auto-generated files

Check if the `about.mappings` files and the `SARLVersion.java` file are containing the correct version numbers.

=== 2.8) Maven Central Bundles

Prepare the bundles for Maven Central:

     $> ./scripts/prepare-maven-central.sh

NOTE: Copy the bundles from `target/maven-central-bundles/` in a safe folder for being used in Phase 3.

=== 2.9) Javadoc Generation

Generate the Javadoc for the public API (the real generation will be done by the Rake script of the website):

     $> ./scripts/generate-aggregate-javadoc.sh

NOTE: Copy the generated website from `target/site/apidocs/` in a safe folder for being used in Phase 3.

=== 2.10) Changelog Generation

Generate the changelog that contains the list of all the changes in the released version:

     $> ./scripts/prepare-release.sh --changes

NOTE: Copy the generated changelog from `target/changes.md` in a safe folder for being used in Phase 3.

=== 2.11) Commit and push to Github

     $> git commit
     $> git push --all origin X.X.X
     
where `X.X.X` is the version of the release that corresponds to the current branch.

=== 2.12) Tag the Git with the version number

     $> git tag "vX.Y.Z"
     $> git push --tags origin X.X.X

where `X.X.X` is the version of the release that corresponds to the current branch.

=== 2.13) Release on the SARL servers.

For uploading the release files onto the SARL server, you could use the provided script:

     $> ./scripts/release.sh

This script needs to have environment variables for defining the SARL server addresses, and the access login.

     export MAVENSARLIO_URL=dav:https://XXX
     export UPDATESSARLIO_URL=dav:https://YYY
     export MAVENSARLIO_USER=ZZZ

These variables may be defined in the user configuration file `$HOME/.sarlrc`, that is automatically loaded by the release script.
