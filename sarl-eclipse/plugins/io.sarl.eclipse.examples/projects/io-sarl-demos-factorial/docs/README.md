# Two examples of factorial computation

The first demo introduces a single agent computing a factorial, the second one introduces two agents in interaction: the first agent asking the second to compute the factorial value of a specified integer.

This code sample provides an illustration of:

* Creation of agents;
* Communication between agents;
* Factorial implementation;
* Kill of the agent.
